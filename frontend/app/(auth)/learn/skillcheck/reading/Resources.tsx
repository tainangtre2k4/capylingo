            '    <p align="center"><strong>Close your eyes and imagine walking along a sandy beach and then gazing over the horizon as the Sun rises. How clear is the image that springs to mind?</strong></p>\n' +
            '    <p>Most people can readily conjure images inside their head - known as their mind\'s eye. But this year scientists have described a condition, aphantasia, in which some people are unable to visualise mental images. </p>\n' +
            '    <p>Niel Kenmuir, from Lancaster, has always had a blind mind\'s eye. He knew he was different even in childhood. "My stepfather, when I couldn\'t sleep, told me to count sheep, and he explained what he meant, I tried to do it and I couldn\'t," he says. "I couldn\'t see any sheep jumping over fences, there was nothing to count."</p>\n' +
            '    <p>Our memories are often tied up in images, think back to a wedding or first day at school. As a result, Niel admits, some aspects of his memory are "terrible", but he is very good at remembering facts. And, like others with aphantasia, he struggles to recognise faces. Yet he does not see aphantasia as a disability, but simply a different way of experiencing life. </p>\n' +
            '    <p style="font-weight:bold;" align="center">Mind\'s eye blind</p>\n' +
            '    <p>Ironically, Niel now works in a bookshop, although he largely sticks to the non-fiction aisles. His condition begs the question what is going on inside his picture-less mind. I asked him what happens when he tries to picture his fiancee. "This is the hardest thing to describe, what happens in my head when I think about things," he says. "When I think about my fiancee there is no image, but I am definitely thinking about her, I know today she has her hair up at the back, she\'s brunette. But I\'m not describing an image I am looking at, I\'m remembering features about her, that\'s the strangest thing and maybe that is a source of some regret."</p>\n' +
            '    <p>The response from his mates is a very sympathetic: "You\'re weird." But while Niel is very relaxed about his inability to picture things, it is often a cause of distress for others. One person who took part in a study into aphantasia said he had started to feel "isolated" and "alone" after discovering that other people could see images in their heads. Being unable to reminisce about his mother years after her death led to him being "extremely distraught".</p>\n' +
            '    <p style="font-weight:bold;" align="center">The super-visualiser</p>\n' +
            '    <p>At the other end of the spectrum is children\'s book illustrator, Lauren Beard, whose work on the Fairytale Hairdresser series will be familiar to many six-year-olds. Her career relies on the vivid images that leap into her mind\'s eye when she reads text from her author. When I met her in her box-room studio in Manchester, she was working on a dramatic scene in the next book. The text describes a baby perilously climbing onto a chandelier.</p>\n' +
            '    "Straightaway I can visualise this grand glass chandelier in some sort of French kind of ballroom, and the little baby just swinging off it and really heavy thick curtains," she says. "I think I have a strong imagination, so I can create the world and then keep adding to it so it gets sort of bigger and bigger in my mind and the characters too they sort of evolve. I couldn\'t really imagine what it\'s like to not imagine, I think it must be a bit of a shame really."<br>\n' +
            '    <p>Not many people have mental imagery as vibrant as Lauren or as blank as Niel. They are the two extremes of visualisation. Adam Zeman, a professor of cognitive and behavioural neurology, wants to compare the lives and experiences of people with aphantasia and its polar-opposite hyperphantasia. His team, based at the University of Exeter, coined the term aphantasia this year in a study in the journal Cortex. </p>\n' +
            '    <p>Prof Zeman tells the BBC: "People who have contacted us say they are really delighted that this has been recognised and has been given a name, because they have been trying to explain to people for years that there is this oddity that they find hard to convey to others." How we imagine is clearly very subjective - one person\'s vivid scene could be another\'s grainy picture. But Prof Zeman is certain that aphantasia is real. People often report being able to dream in pictures, and there have been reported cases of people losing the ability to think in images after a brain injury. </p>\n' +
            '    <p>He is adamant that aphantasia is "not a disorder" and says it may affect up to one in 50 people. But he adds: "I think it makes quite an important difference to their experience of life because many of us spend our lives with imagery hovering somewhere in the mind\'s eye which we inspect from time to time, it\'s a variability of human experience." </p>\n' +

        <p align="center"><strong>Life lessons from villains, crooks and gangsters</strong></p>
        <p><strong>(A)</strong> A notorious Mexican drug baron’s audacious escape from prison in July doesn’t, at first,
            appear to have much to teach corporate boards.
            But some in the business world suggest otherwise. Beyond the morally reprehensible side of
                criminals' work, some business gurus say organised crime syndicates, computer hackers, pirates and
                others operating outside the law could teach legitimate corporations a thing or two about how to hustle
                and respond to rapid change.</p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(B)</strong> Far from encouraging illegality, these gurus argue that – in the same way big
            corporations sometimes emulate start-ups – business leaders could learn from the underworld about
            flexibility, innovation and the ability to pivot quickly. “There is a nimbleness to criminal organisations
            that legacy corporations [with large, complex layers of management] don’t have,” said Marc Goodman, head of
            the Future Crimes Institute and global cyber-crime advisor. While traditional businesses focus on rules they
            have to follow, criminals look to circumvent them. “For criminals, the sky is the limit and that creates the
            opportunity to think much, much bigger.”</p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(C)</strong> Joaquin Guzman, the head of the Mexican Sinaloa drug cartel, for instance, slipped out
            of his prison cell through a tiny hole in his shower that led to a mile-long tunnel fitted with lights and
            ventilation. Making a break for it required creative thinking, long-term planning and perseverance –
            essential skills similar to those needed to achieve success in big business.</p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(D)</strong> While Devin Liddell, who heads brand strategy for Seattle-based design consultancy,
            Teague, condemns the violence and other illegal activities he became curious as to how criminal groups
            endure. Some cartels stay in business despite multiple efforts by law enforcement on both sides of the US
            border and millions of dollars from international agencies to shut them down. Liddell genuinely believes
            there’s a lesson in longevity here. One strategy he underlined was how the bad guys respond to change. In
            order to bypass the border between Mexico and the US, for example, the Sinaloa cartel went to great lengths.
            It built a vast underground tunnel, hired family members as border agents and even used a catapult to
            circumvent a high-tech fence.</p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(E)</strong> By contrast, many legitimate businesses fail because they hesitate to adapt quickly to
            changing market winds. One high-profile example is movie and game rental company Blockbuster, which didn’t
            keep up with the market and lost business to mail order video rentals and streaming technologies. The brand
            has all but faded from view.&nbsp;Liddell argues the difference between the two groups is that criminal
            organisations often have improvisation encoded into their daily behaviour, while larger companies think of
            innovation as a set process. “This is a leadership challenge,” said Liddell. “How well companies innovate
            and organise is a reflection of leadership.”</p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>Left-field thinking</strong></p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(F)</strong> Cash-strapped start-ups also use unorthodox strategies to problem solve and build their
            businesses up from scratch. This creativity and innovation is often borne out of necessity, such as tight
            budgets.&nbsp;Both criminals and start-up founders “question authority, act outside the system and see new
            and clever ways of doing things,” said Goodman. “Either they become Elon Musk or El Chapo.” And, some
            entrepreneurs aren’t even afraid to operate in legal grey areas in their effort to disrupt the marketplace.
            The co-founders of music streaming service Napster, for example, knowingly broke music copyright rules with
            their first online file sharing service, but their technology paved the way for legal innovation as
            regulators caught up.</p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(G)</strong> Goodman and others believe thinking hard about problem solving before worrying about
            restrictions could prevent established companies falling victim to rivals less constrained by tradition. In
            their book The Misfit Economy, Alexa Clay and Kyra Maya Phillips examine how individuals can apply that
            mindset to become more innovative and entrepreneurial within corporate structures. They studied not just
            violent criminals like Somali pirates, but others who break the rules in order to find creative solutions to
            their business problems, such as people living in the slums of Mumbai or computer hackers. They picked out
            five common traits among this group: the ability to hustle, pivot, provoke, hack and copycat.</p>
        <p><br>
            <strong>(H)</strong> Clay gives a Saudi entrepreneur named Walid Abdul-Wahab as a prime example. Abdul-Wahab
            worked with Amish farmers to bring camel milk to American consumers even before US regulators approved it.
            Through perseverance, he eventually found a network of Amish camel milk farmers and started selling the
            product via social media. Now his company, Desert Farms, sells to giant mainstream retailers like Whole
            Foods Market. Those on the fringe don’t always have the option of traditional, corporate jobs and that
            forces them to think more creatively about how to make a living, Clay said. They must develop grit and
            resilience in order to last outside the cushy confines of cubicle life. “In many cases scarcity is the
            mother of invention,” Clay said.</p>

        <h2 align="center">Britain needs strong TV industry</h2>
        <p>Comedy writer Armando Iannucci has called for an industry-wide defence of the BBC and British
            programme-makers. <em>"The Thick of It"</em> creator made his remarks in the annual MacTaggart Lecture at
            the Edinburgh TV Festival.</p>
            <p>"It's more important than ever that we have more strong, popular channels... that act as beacons, drawing
                audiences to the best content," he said. Speaking earlier, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale rejected
                suggestions that he wanted to dismantle the BBC.</p>
            <p style="font-weight:bold;">'Champion supporters'</p>
            <p>Iannucci co-wrote <em>"I'm Alan Partridge"</em>, wrote the movie <em>"In the Loop"</em> and created and
                wrote the hit <em>"HBO"</em> and <em>"Sky Atlantic show Veep"</em>. He delivered the 40th annual
                MacTaggart Lecture, which has previously been given by Oscar winner Kevin Spacey, former BBC director
                general Greg Dyke, Jeremy Paxman and Rupert Murdoch. Iannucci said: "Faced with a global audience,
                British television needs its champion supporters."</p>
            <p>
                He continued his praise for British programming by saying the global success of American TV shows had
                come about because they were emulating British television. "The best US shows are modelling themselves
                on what used to make British TV so world-beating," he said. "US prime-time schedules are now littered
                with those quirky formats from the UK - the <em>"Who Do You Think You Are"</em>'s and the variants
                on <em>"Strictly Come Dancing"</em> - as well as the single-camera non-audience sitcom, which we brought
                into the mainstream first. We have changed international viewing for the better."</p>
            <p>
                With the renewal of the BBC's royal charter approaching, Iannucci also praised the corporation. He said:
                "If public service broadcasting - one of the best things we've ever done creatively as a country - if it
                was a car industry, our ministers would be out championing it overseas, trying to win contracts,
                boasting of the British jobs that would bring." In July, the government issued a green paper setting out
                issues that will be explored during negotiations over the future of the BBC, including the broadcaster's
                size, its funding and governance.</p>
            <p>
                Primarily Mr Whittingdale wanted to appoint a panel of five people, but finally he invited two more
                people to advise on the channer renewal, namely former Channel 4 boss Dawn Airey and journalism
                professor Stewart Purvis, a former editor-in-chief of ITN. Iannucci bemoaned the lack of "creatives"
                involved in the discussions. </p>
            <p>
                "When the media, communications and information industries make up nearly 8% our GDP, larger than the
                car and oil and gas industries put together, we need to be heard, as those industries are heard. But
                when I see the panel of experts who've been asked by the culture secretary to take a root and branch
                look at the BBC, I don't see anyone who is a part of that cast and crew list. I see executives, media
                owners, industry gurus, all talented people - but not a single person who's made a classic and enduring
                television show."</p>
            <p style="font-weight:bold;">'Don't be modest'</p>
            <p>Iannucci suggested one way of easing the strain on the licence fee was "by pushing ourselves more
                commercially abroad". </p>
            <p>
                "Use the BBC's name, one of the most recognised brands in the world," he said. "And use the reputation
                of British television across all networks, to capitalise financially oversees. Be more aggressive in
                selling our shows, through advertising, through proper international subscription channels, freeing up
                BBC Worldwide to be fully commercial, whatever it takes.</p>
            <p>
                "Frankly, don't be icky and modest about making money, let's monetise the bezeesus Mary and Joseph out
                of our programmes abroad so that money can come back, take some pressure off the licence fee at home and
                be invested in even more ambitious quality shows, that can only add to our value."</p>
            <p>
                Mr Whittingdale, who was interviewed by ITV News' Alastair Stewart at the festival, said he wanted an
                open debate about whether the corporation should do everything it has done in the past. &nbsp;He said he
                had a slight sense that people who rushed to defend the BBC were "trying to have an argument that's
                never been started".</p>
            <p>
                "Whatever my view is, I don't determine what programmes the BBC should show," he added. "That's the job of the BBC." Mr Whittingdale said any speculation that the Conservative Party had always wanted to change the BBC due to issues such as its editorial line was "absolute nonsense".</p>
