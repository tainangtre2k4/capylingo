# Github rules

1. `Branch name`
- Most branches should be named like this: **feat/CSD-(task-name-with-hyphen)**. For example, the branch for the task **Change the definition** should be named **feat/CSD-change-the-definition**.
- At the setting up stage, we should replace **feat** by **setup**.
2. **Please, for the sake of reading, write sensible commit message.**
3. Please resolve all errors and warnings before commiting.
4. Before merging the branch, a pull request for the branch must be opened and all changes in it must be approved **by at least 2 people**.
    - A pull request can only be opened when **the code is ready for review**.
    - It can have the same name as the branch for simplicity's sake.
    - It should have a description about **what have been done in the code** and **how to use the new feature** to make review easier.
    - It should be linked to the corresponding Trello task to make it easier to find.

##### Note: More rules might be added later on.
